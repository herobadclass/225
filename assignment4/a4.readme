For the methods for this assignment, a max heap was used for List1 and a binary search tree was used for List2. My heap implementation from Assignment 3 was slightly edited and used for this assignment to implement List1. I used a binary searched tree for List2 because it is less tedious to implement a search function than in a max heap. The code for implementing functions for the binary search tree were gathered from the public website "Cprogramming" and can be found at: cprogramming.com/tutorial/lesson18.html. The first (largest) element from List1 is compared to all elements of List2 and the following can occur:
	1. If the element from List1 is not found in List2, the value is printed.
	2. If an element in List1 is found in List2, then go to the next element in list1 and compare that to List2 and repeat until a solution is found that satisfies (1.), or until List1 become empty.
	3. If List1 is empty (to begin with), or there are are no more elements left, print 'None.'
